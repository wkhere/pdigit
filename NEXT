- various separators for numbers in input (not only spaces)
+ output separator for number chunks given by flag
+ accept non-digits in front of number (eg. IBAN)
+ treat ansi color chars like whitespaces, pass them further
  note: digits are actually terminated by a single ESC char
+ impl: process line directly to the writer

+ cosmetic: lexer.acceptAny should be actually acceptRun,
  robpike was right
- actually, lexer should not know about the number of digits
  to split, it can just return digits token;
  splitting can just happen in the processor
